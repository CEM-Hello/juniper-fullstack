        <p>Our spirits are created through experimentation, creativity and adventure. We broaden our palate and craft by

            HOW WE BEGAN
            <span>A Pioneer in Craft Distilling</span>
          </h2>
          <div class="top-p">
            It was all a dream, and it started with a bottle of moonshine. Before the little distillery on Capital Hill,
            long before the barrel warehouse, and way before the restaurant, Juniper Distilling Co. was just a dream to
            our founders. A dream that their passion for creating spirits they liked to drink, could be shared with
            everyone. This was all realized back in 2013 when our distillery was established. And these are our spirits
            we'd like to share.

          Juniper Distilling Co. is named after the greatest German Shepherd who ever lived—sorry, fellow dog owners,
          this is a non-debatable fact and completely unbiased. Dogs are welcome at our bottle shop and even at private

          Juniper Distilling Co. produces small, hand-crafted batches of Gins, Vodkas, Tequilas and Whiskeys. This is
          the real deal—spirits made with a sense of place and a connection to the people who grew the raw ingredients
          and the man who coaxed them into their more spirited forms—gins in which you can taste the botanical’s,
          distinctive vodkas, savory tequilas and whiskeys that are flavorful and smooth.
